**Adds two hotkeys (v1.0.0)**\
An elytra/chestplate swapping keybind. It prioritises items with a larger durability and then with a larger amount of enchant levels. Will also prioritize chestplates/elytra that are in your offhand. Default keybind 'G'.

A quick totem equipping keybind. Will equip a totem of undying into your offhand when pressed. Default keybind 'X'.

**Adds automatic elytra swapping (v1.1.0)**\
When enabled, this will automatically equip your elytra when you attempt to fly with your chestplate still on. This is disabled by default and can be toggled in the mod config menu (accessible via mod menu).

**Extensive config (v1.2.0)**\
A config screen is available via the Mod Menu.\
It has several different options:
* Automatic elytra swapping toggle
* Swap fireworks to your offhand automatically while gliding with an elytra, being switched back on landing
* Configure a list of which elytra items will be scanned on swapping an elytra
* Configure a list of which offhand items will be scanned on performing the offhand swap
* Configure a list of valid firework items for the automatic firework swap

This mod is a remake of my older mod **Quick Elytra**. If you would like to use this mod for a Minecraft version before 1.20, use Quick Elytra instead.\
